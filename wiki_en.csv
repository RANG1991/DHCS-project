1,Table without correct end,"{| class=""wikitable""|-{| class=""wikitab","Found no end of the table. ""|}"" generally needs to be added. MediaWiki generally displays the table despite the missing end, but content below the table gets mixed into the table. Where an infobox is more suitable than the table, the article's talk page could be tagged with {{newinfobox}}.","Different markup for start and end : If wiki syntax ""{|"" is used to start the table, the end tag should be ""|}"".  There are cases were a template can end a table, such as {{fb end}}. This is perfectly fine to do.",Following tools can warn of a problem:,AutoWikiBrowser (AWB),WPCleaner,Edit
